Views Slideshow: ImageFlow Advanced plugin. 

DESCRIPTION 
=========== 
The Views Slideshow: ImageFlow Advanced module adds a Views display for 
showing rows as items in a ImageFlow slideshow 
(http://finnrudolph.de/ImageFlow). 

This module is a advanced and updated version of original Views 
Slideshow: ImageFlow Advanced module by aaron. This module has more 
configurable options and actively maintained. 

ImageFlow is not distributed under GPL and is not free, therefore it is
